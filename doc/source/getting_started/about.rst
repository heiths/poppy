Primary Mission
===============

Poppy's primary mission is to provide a generic and modular vendor-neutral API that wraps provisioning instructions for CDN vendors that support it.

Status
======
**Production Ready**
Poppy is Production Ready and is currently deployed at Rackspace.


Design
======
Poppy is an OpenStack=related project to provide a generic and modular vendor=neutral API which wraps provisioning instructions for CDN vendors that support it.

Poppy, as with all OpenStack projects, is written with the following design
guidelines in mind:

* **Component=based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault tolerant**: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community=driven api
